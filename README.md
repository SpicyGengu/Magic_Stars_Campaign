# Magic_Stars_Campaign
 My Pathfinder 2e campaign I'm running for my homies.
## SPOILER ALERT!!!
If you are one of my players, for the love of God don't snoop around in this. The thing is riddled with spoilers. Even places like session recaps have them. Don't ruin the fun for yourself. I ofcourse have no intention of stopping you if you really incist but yeah be warned. 
## Dependencies-esk
I have created some 3d towns and models that are only viewable in the game Townscaper. So if you wanna see those you will need to buy the game. Unless you figure something out with the demo version that can be found here: https://oskarstalberg.com/Townscaper/. Go check it out!
