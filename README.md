# Magic_Stars_Campaign
 My Pathfinder 2e campaign I'm running for my homies.
# _**SPOILER ALERT!!!**_
If you are one of my players, for the love of God don't snoop around in this. The thing is riddled with spoilers. Even places like session recaps have them. Don't ruin the fun for yourself. I of course have no intention of stopping you if you really insist, but yeah be warned. 

## Description
This is a campaign I've been running for a while now. It consists of locations, npcs, lore and some general world-building stuff. Main purpose of this repository is for me to be able to sync the obsidian vault with my Linux and Windows machines for free. I made it public for a few reasons. 
### Interested in my way of documenting a campaign?
This repo is for anyone interested in an alternative way to document their campaign. I personally find this to be one of the easier and more fun ways of keeping track of the world I have created. Looking at the graph view is so nice. I color coded everything in a way that makes the whole graph just that more understandable. Check it out if you're interested.
### Need some test data for a project?
This vault is very populated. While maybe niche, this fantasy world could be used for testing a project that would need such a thing. There are all sorts of connections and correlations that might be interesting to take a look at.
### Inspiration?
The campaign has a bunch of home brew I simply made up. If you find any of it interesting and want to implement it into your campaign, feel free to do so.
### Pure curiosity?
Listen do what you want. If you want to come in and read the session recaps every now and again, go ahead. I mean I get it. You won't be hearing any judgment from me at least.

## Dependencies-esk
### Obsidian
This is an obsidian vault, if you don't have obsidian go install it here: https://obsidian.md/download. You will have to enable community plugins, but they should auto install when you open this vault.
### Townscaper
I have created some 3D towns and models that are only viewable in the game Townscaper. So if you wanna see those you will need to buy the game. Unless you figure something out with the demo version that can be found here: https://oskarstalberg.com/Townscaper/. Go check it out!

## Functionalities
- Color coded notes relative to area, sub-area, status and type of note
- 3D graph of the notes
- Every note has a mini-map in it's banner
- Notes link to each other just like Wikipedia
