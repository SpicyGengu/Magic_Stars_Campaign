An operation started by the [[Kali Elites]] in the [[Living City of Kali]], to essentially deport all the homeless people out of Kali. Sending all the homeless and poor out into the mountains to get killed. [[New Kali]] was built so the deportees have an incentive to leave. The village is not meant to last. It is in Kali's interest that the village gets attacked and destroyed by [[The Mountain Tribes]]. The village is armed with guards and weapons, but the guards were purposefully picked to be the most problematic ones. Common name the guards go by is [[The Knights of New Kali]]. This was done with the idea that the guards would probably provoke [[The Mountain Tribes]] and get themselves and everyone else in [[New Kali]] killed in the process. This is highly immoral and is therefore being kept among one of top secrets.

The operation succeeded [[New Kali]] is no more. A few people survived, but there is no way they can survive the harsh mountain environment after such a devastating explosion.
