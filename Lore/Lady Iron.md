#Lore #Stribor_Forest 
At first glance an iron maiden like any other with two arms crossing into a hug as to resemble the warm embrace of death. Upon closer inspection it becomes clear that its walls are made not only to keep people inside, but to keep them out as well. The lady is as much a shield as she is a trap. On her side a signature masterfully carved out, [[Jakov Miličić]]. 
# Functionality
Lady Iron functions much like holding 2 fortress shields at once. You can choose to raise one or both halves of the Lady each craving an action.
