#Lore 
Goggles manufactured in [[Badija and Ophilia]]. One could call them an artificers best friend. By merely observing a peace of technology, the goggles reveal it's every minute detail. It is like having the objects blueprint right in front of you.
# Notes
- Allows the user to target weak spots of the mechanism and disable it efficiently with a roll.
- Can be used to overclock some mechanisms to make them temporarily better. Just like the invention of an inventor.
- Can be used to copy schematics.
