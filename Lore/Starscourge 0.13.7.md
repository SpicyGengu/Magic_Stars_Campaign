#Lore 
Produced by [[Living City of Kali]]'s best wizards, the Starscourge is a proof of concept thought to be impossible. A prototype of a weapon made to dispel magic. An invention the world is simply not ready for. An invention that is so revolutionary it created a new school of magic, [[Disspelling Magic]].
# Lore
As the name would imply this is merely one of many prototypes made and improved. Designed by [[Petra Oklopska]], it wasn't manufactured by her. In fact she doesn't even know of it's existence. The design was stolen by Kali spies appointed the task of keeping the [[Badija-Ophilia civil war]] going. This is why the Starscourge is being shipped all the way from [[Badija and Ophilia]].
# Notes
- To charge, it needs 3 gold pieces worth of [[Star fragment]]s and a full day before it's ready.
