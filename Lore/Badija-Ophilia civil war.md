An internal war fuelled by propaganda secretly encouraged by the [[Kali Elites]]. 
# Conspiracy
The war is being secretly supported by [[Living City of Kali]]. Kali is currently the most powerful and influential city in the world, due to the monopoly they hold over the [[Star Fragment]]s. Being smaller than [[Badija and Ophilia]], the [[Kali Elites]] felt threatened of losing the stranglehold they have on [[Star Fragment]]s, and that's why they started the civil war to destabilise the city, crippling it's infrastructure, upholding their place in the hagiarchy.
