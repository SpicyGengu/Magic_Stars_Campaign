# Culture
They burry their fallen comrades with their boots tide over the grave.
# Sand Diving
Antikal have developed their own method of hiding in sand in the [[Yarrow Dessert]]. While diving they are practically invisible. A complex combination of breath control and spatial awareness, together with the understanding of sands physical properties are needed to master this skill properly. The members of Antikal are able to teach this skill in roughly about a months time.
# Kali Sabotage Plans
## Destruction of the [[Jerboa Mine]]
The [[Jerboa Mine]] is a very volatile structure due to the instability of raw [[Star fragment]]s. One well placed magical explosive should be enough to bring everything down. First of, this would be a big hit on [[Living City of Kali]]'s economic income. Secondly, with all of the mines resources gone, [[Living City of Kali]] would no longer be needing anything [[Mining Town of Jerboa]] has to provide, and slowly but surely the [[Living City of Kali]] will leave [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]] to take care of itself. Without the mine [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]] is nothing but an unnecessary expense.
## [[Train Heist]]
Antikal has recently caught wind of some very special, top secret shipment headed for [[Living City of Kali]] via train. The shipment is being sent from [[Badija and Ophilia]] and just so happens to be passing through, wouldn't you know it [[Mining Town of Jerboa]]. Whatever is in that shipment must be very important to them, they hired an absurd amount of guards to protect the train. Destroying the shipment will definitely be a good jab at Kali, but stealing it... It might just be the biggest bargaining chip Antikal can realistically acquire.
# Post [[(Session 9) Conquered]]
Antikal decided to do the [[Train Heist]] just as they planned. On the day of the heist, the gang was surprised to find the train unguarded, all for but one guard, [[Conquest]]. The plan was working just as intended in the beginning. The train was derailed to go for [[Magnolia]] instead of [[Living City of Kali|Kali]]. [[Jimmy]], [[Emma]] and [[Kazu]] were placed as snipers at the back of the train, to provide complimentary backup fire for the rest of Antikal while fighting [[Conquest]]. But everything went south as soon as the first sniper shot was fired. In the blink of an eye [[Conquest]] flew over to the snipers. Rest of the gang knew they had to do something fast. They started opening the vault. They miraculously managed to open it. They took everything inside and tried to flee. Unfortunately they were too late. [[Conquest]] was at the door waiting for them. He had taken care of the other 3 members. Antikal fought long and hard, and when everything seemed hopeless a huge crash. The train ran into head on collision with another train, just outside of the town of [[Magnolia]]. You see the vault train was never meant to be in [[Magnolia]] so a train leaving [[Magnolia]] was able to be scheduled. The chaos of the whole situation was just high enough for a successful escape. Only 3 members just barely survived the whole encounter. [[Rosa]], [[Gregor]] and [[Jonny]]. They fled to the woods just outside [[Magnolia]] and made a temporary [[Tree House Hideout (Antikal Jerboa)]].
