[[Living City of Kali|Kali]] deeply understands the power of changelings. This is why they very often abuse their powers for their own good. Changelings are not treated as valuable members of society, but are instead treated as assets and slaves meant to serve.
# Examples
- [[Golden Barrel#Prostitutes]]
- [[(Session 10) Knights of New Jerboa]]
