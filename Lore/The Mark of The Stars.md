#Lore 
A mark resembling a star. Acquiring the mark can be achieved by committing an act of heresy set fourth by [[Sombra de los Muertos]]. Some examples include destroying the monolith in a [[Star Tomb]], or unjustly removing a soul from it's body. The more acts of heresy one commits the more the scar expands, and the stronger it's effects are.
# Side Effects
Getting hunted by the undead.
