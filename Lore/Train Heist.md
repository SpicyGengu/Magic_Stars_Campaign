#Yarrow_Dessert #Lore 
A shipment was sent from [[Badija and Ophilia]] containing classified items very important to the [[Living City of Kali]]. Among others, the train is planned to stop at the [[Jerboa Train Station]] in the [[Mining Town of Jerboa]]. 
# Rail Arches
Along the train-track there are points on the path where the front of the train has a clear view of the very [[#Last Wagon]] of the train.
# Track Switch
The train is planned to be on it's way to [[Entrance to Kali]]. On it's way a switch can be flipped along the tracks that will send the train straight for [[Magnolia]]. At this fork in the road, if manipulated correctly, the train can be derailed.
# Disconnecting Wagons
Every wagon but one can be easily detached from the rest of the train. The [[#Vault Wagon]] is the only wagon that is almost impossible to detach from the locomotive.
# [[Đorđe Balašević]]
[[Đorđe Balašević]] is hitching a ride to the [[#Track Switch]]. He is planning to get on another train headed for [[Badija and Ophilia]]. 
# [[Zina]]
Aboard this train a very particular NPC will be introduced. [[Zina]] will appear seemingly out of nowhere. They will just be curious and happy to be there. They are on their way to where ever the train takes them. 
# [[Antikal (Jerboa)]]
[[Antikal (Jerboa)]] wants whatever is in that [[#Vault Wagon]]. They believe that whatever [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] is protecting in there can be used as a very powerful bargaining chip. They have a pretty elaborate plan on how to get into the [[#Vault Wagon]]. One of their men will take control of the turret that is located on the [[#Last Wagon]]. 
# Train Layout
## Last Wagon
The wagon furthest away from the locomotive is equipped with a person controlled turret. The turret has a clear line of sight at the "Entrance to the Vault Wagon" and can be operated by anyone. If not disabled the turret will shoot in bursts of 3 rounds with a cool down of 2 rounds. At the start of each round while the turret is shooting everyone will need to roll a dex-save of 26 or over, or take 2d6 damconquest actorage (critical fails are doubled). 
## Farm Animal Wagons
The train is comprised of multiple wagons carrying barn animals. All of these animals are stamped with a [[Kali Entrance Certification]].
## Marble Statues Wagon
At about the midpoint of the wagons there is a strangely unguarded wagon filled with marble statues. The wagon has no walls and barely any guard rails. Once someone walks on the wagon the statues come alive and attack. Most common attack is grabbing a target and chucking themselves off the train with them. The statues keep re-spawning seemingly out of thin air. To kill all of them, one needs to disable the [[Star fragment]] located underneath the running wagon.

## Child Container Wagons
There are several wagons that are simply containers carrying children, most orphans of war. These children are being sent to [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] to become trained child soldiers. 
## Entrance to the Vault Wagon
Before entering the vault wagon the party will be met with [[Conquest]]. No-one in [[Mining Town of Jerboa]] could have warned them about this. [[Conquest]] will request for them to leave. At the most minimal sign of resistance he will get overjoyed and start the fight. 
## Vault Wagon
This wagon is where the shipment is located. It is also the wagon closest to the locomotive. If the party manages to get inside it, there will be one last line of defense. A hologram projecting from the roof will appear. [[Filip Sinclair]]. He will say the following:
"Listen to me, and listen to me carefully. Whatever you think is in this shipment, is not worth the trouble you will be going through were you to steal it. Trust me, it is not. What you are going to do now is; you are going to take those classified documents on the table there, along with the [[Star fragment]]s. These documents withhold information about weak points in the [[Living City of Kali]]s defense systems. These documents are FAKE! You will be giving those to whoever hired you. I am trying to save your life not theirs. The money you can keep. In the following few weeks we will be paying you an additional 4000 [[Star fragment]]s if you follow through with the plan. Is the deal clear?!"
# Conclusion
During and following [[(Session 9) Conquered]], the train was ambushed by the players. They wiped out all of the guards, disconnected the [[#Last Wagon]] and disabled the [[#Marble Statues Wagon]]. Only thing they didn't manage was getting past [[Conquest]]. Almost getting killed they ditched the heist and left with [[Zina]]. Some time after that the train passed [[Jerboa Train Station]]. Even though it didn't stop in [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]], [[Đorđe Balašević]] still managed to hop on the train. Soon after [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]], [[Antikal (Jerboa)]] members ambushed the train as well. They set-up their positions, flipped the [[#Track Switch]] and aimed the train for [[Magnolia]]. They abused the [[#Rail Arches]] in their fight with [[Conquest]] and managed to open the [[#Vault Wagon]]. Managing to escape with [[#The Shipment]] thanks to a train crash. Only 3 [[Antikal (Jerboa)]] members survived. [[Đorđe Balašević]] got badly injured but managed to recover.
