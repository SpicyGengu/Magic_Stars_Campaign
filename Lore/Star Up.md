#Lore #Magnolian_Sea 
A new group of fighters going by the name "Star Up" has started preforming at the [[Magnolian Colosseum]] following the events of [[(Session 11) Greenleaf falls]]. They became famous in [[Magnolia]] first for defeating [[The Lightning Dragon]], and thereafter for being the first to disobey [[Arthur]]s rule in the Colosseum.
