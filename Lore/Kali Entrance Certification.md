#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges/Kali #Lore 
A document etched with [[Star fragment]]s in such a way that it is extremely hard to replicate. Each certification is unique. It is a countermeasure of [[Living City of Kali]] to prevent unauthorised visitors from entering. You can forget everything about entering Kali if you don't have one of these. You can't even make it through the [[Entrance to Kali]].
# Notes
- Only person who has even come close to creating a valid replica of the certification was [[Ado Fabriccado]]
