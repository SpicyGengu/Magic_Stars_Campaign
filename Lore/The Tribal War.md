#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges/Dracona #Lore 
[[The Mountain Tribes]] are at war. The war was started when the tribe of [[Igni]] attacked with the intent of uniting the [[The Mountain Tribes]] as one.
# Cause of war
Due to [[Operation Beyond Borders]], most homeless people in [[Living City of Kali]] have been transported to the village of [[New Kali]]. The erection of a new village so close to the [[Igni Settlement]], sparked concern and curiosity from the people of [[Igni]]. After a few failed scouting missions, the people of [[Igni]] simply accepted that peace was not an option and started preparing for war. Judging by the weaponry [[New Kali]] presented in battle, the people of [[Igni]] decided that uniting [[The Mountain Tribes]] was the only path to victory. 
# Side one
- [[Igni]] lead by [[Žar]]
- [[Gazul]] lead by [[Žar]] (until a new earth wielder is found)
# Side two
- [[Voda]] lead by the [[Water Twins]] ([[Lynn]] and [[Flynn]])
# Neutral
- [[Matte]] lead by [[Azur]]
# Post [[(Session 5) Nuke-ali]]
Side one has now acquired firearms with a help from [[Argon Silliax]]. They have also taken control over [[Dracona Outpost (Near Dragon Cave)]]. Pushing the war slightly more to their side. If nothing changes side one will, very slowly but surely win the war. In some time they might even find [[Maverick]] and find [[Gazul]] a new leader. This will win them the war even quicker.
