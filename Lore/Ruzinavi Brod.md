# Original lyrics
---
Vise ne pantin ca san tija  
kad san bija lud i mlad  
s kime san cile noci bija  
s kin san karta, s kin san pija  

I ko je sve za menon plaka  
kad bi odrisiva kraj  
mozda me tamo di sad iden  
ceka raj  

### Ref.  
Debelin moren  
sad me vozi stari ruzinavi brod  
po provi mu restu frizi  
a timun mi uvik bizi  
tamo di bi tija  
i tamo di ne bi smija  
more je izabralo put  

Na kraju moran ti reci  
da vec dobro vidin kraj  
da su valovi sve veci  
da mi ne lici na raj  

Samo olupine stare  
ca su zarile za dno  
pa ni ono ca san tija  
ca san godinama snija nije to  

Ref. 3x
# Translated lyrics

I no longer remember what I wanted
when I was crazy and young
with whom I spent my nights
with whom I played cards, with whom I drank

And who were the ones that cried for me
when I would cast off to the end
maybe it is there where I am now headed
that heaven awaits

### Chorus
Thick sea
now I sail this rusty boat
on it's bow the sea-salt ripples
and the tiller is always fleeing
somewhere, where it wants to 
and there where it's not supposed to 
the sea has chosen it's course

In the end I have to tell you 
that I already clearly see the end
that the waves are only getting bigger
that it doesn't look like paradise

Only ancient wreckage's
that have sunken to the depths
so not even that, which I wanted
which I dreamt of for years, isn't it
