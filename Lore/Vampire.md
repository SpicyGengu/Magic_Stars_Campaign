Vampires are a birth defect found in all races. What separates them from regular people is the power to steal the life force of others and use it for themselves. Vampires have the same natural lifespan as their racial counterpart, but sucking blood changes this. Every time they suck blood they shorten the creatures lifespan and prolong their own. Doing this to creatures with advanced cognitive abilities, can become addictive. We call this [[Blood Addiction]]. When a vampire oversteps their natural lifespan they have to keep drinking blood daily in order to stay alive. Every day without blood results in a stage up of both exhaustion and dying conditions.
