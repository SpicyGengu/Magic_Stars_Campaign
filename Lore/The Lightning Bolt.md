#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges/Dracona #Lore 
A bow infused with the soul of [[Antesillax]]. Made by [[Sombra de los Muertos]] himself. It is a bow that resembles a blue dragon. The bow is made of scales, flesh and bone. No arrows are needed for this bow, it shoots pure lightning bolts. 
# Appearance
This blue scaled bow resembles a flying dragon. It's wings look just like dragon wings, and it has a dragon head from which the bolts fly out of.
# Stats
It's perk is that whenever a shot connects it zaps up to 2 consecutive opponents with a d4 lightning damage within a 15 foot radius. It deals 100% lightning damage. Contrary to popular belief, lightning does strike twice, and so too can this lightning bolt hit an opponent again if it jumps back and fourth.
