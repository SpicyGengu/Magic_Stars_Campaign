#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges/New_Kali #Location #Dead-Gone 
The newest addition to the [[Silbian Mountain Ranges]] is the village of New Kali. It lies just far enough away from the [[Living City of Kali]] for Kali residents not to know it exists, and just close enough to the [[Igni Settlement]] for the tribe of [[Igni]] to feel like they are under attack.
# Mindset
People of New Kali have been told their whole lives to fear [[The Mountain Tribes]], seeing how they are uneducated savages indulging in taboo and immoral rituals. This creates tension every time a group of them decide to investigate the new village.
# New Kali Catastrophe
Due to the events of [[(Session 4) The Undying]], New Kali is as of [[(Session 5) Nuke-ali]] going to explode in 2 days. If not prepared and in the vicinity the party will get 12d6 damage and be drained 2. The whole village will be levelled and there will survive a 1d100/4 amount of people in the city.
