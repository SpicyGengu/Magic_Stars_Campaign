# Piano

# Poker table

# Five finger knife game table
In the saloon one table is specifically reserved to the five finger knife game. The way the players will play is by rolling one D20 for each finger. Rolling above 10 is a successful passing of a finger. 10 or less means that you cut your finger, you take 2 slashing damage when this happens. A natural 1 means that you cut your finger off, you also take 2d4 damage. A natural 20 negates one cut, but it doesn't save you from losing a finger. Who ever cuts themselves the least wins that round. Each proficiency in thievery gives a +2 to the roll.
# Performances
The saloon sometimes get's guest performers from [[Living City of Kali]]. It's a tactic deployed by [[Kali Elites]] to infiltrate Jerboan culture and replace it with their own.
