#Stribor_Forest #Location 
When the players eventually decide to go to [[Stribor Forest]] they will first be met with the music from the wedding playing in the distance. [[Sokolov]] family is celebrating a wedding, somewhat far away from [[Badija and Ophilia]]. With [[Vijera Sokolova]] as the bride and [[Andrej Belic]] soon to be Andrej [[Sokolov]] as the groom. As per usual both sides of the family are there. The wedding is held a secret seeing as the [[Badija-Ophilia civil war]] going on, and the weight some of the people attending have on it.

# The conflict
Of course with a wedding of this calibre there are a few [[Ophilian]] spies wandering about. Not to worry though, [[Damir Sokolov]] is there to make sure they get taken care of. Now [[Vijera Sokolova]] is not so found of people dying at her wedding and restrains Damir from killing anyone even if they are spies. Now this works on Damir, but only when directly confronted by Vijera.
