# [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] ambush
If the party manages to find this place [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] soldiers will have been following them. [[Tayanna Sinclair]] will offer the party a choice depending on how their interaction with [[Antikal (Jerboa)]] goes. Her ultimate goal is to retrieve the goods stolen in the [[Train Heist]].
## [[Antikal (Jerboa)]] interaction outcomes
- Handing over the [[Train Heist]] loot, [[Tayanna Sinclair]] awards 4000 [[Star fragment]]s
- Killing [[Antikal (Jerboa)]], [[Tayanna Sinclair]] awards 1000 [[Star fragment]]s
- Leading [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] to [[Antikal (Jerboa)]], [[Tayanna Sinclair]] awards 1000 [[Star fragment]]s
The party will be paid according to these 3 factors. The awards are accumulative meaning the max payout for this quest is 6000 [[Star fragment]]s. If none of these are met no award will be rewarded.
