#Magnolian_Sea #Location 
A barbershop in [[Magnolia]] that prides itself on being traditional and old fashioned. They are very against transhumanism, but not to the extent that they would prohibit customers with prosthetics. As one can imagine they are not big fans of [[Ado Fabriccado]]s work. 
# Notes
- The place is a hotspot for [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] spies.
