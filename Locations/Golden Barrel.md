#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges/New_Kali #Location #Dead-Gone 
A brothel, casino, bar and a hotel all in one only in [[New Kali]]. This is where most citizens of [[New Kali]] go to forget that they are citizens of [[New Kali]].
# Poker table
At the poker table one can often find [[Mauna Loa]] playing. She is a very aggressive player since she essentially only plays with [[New Kali]]s tax [[Star fragment]]s.
# Prostitutes
The prostitutes are very flirty and pushy, a bunch of them are changelings and open to essentially anything.
# Bar
The bar is where [[Tom Tender]] can be found, he is the bar keep of the [[Golden Barrel]].
# Performances
The Golden Barrel often has very famous people from [[Living City of Kali]] preforming. For some reason a bunch of Kali celebrities come to visit the golden barrel. Mysteriously the same celebrities are never seen anywhere else in [[New Kali]]. It all smells of changelings.
# [[Traveling Carriage (New Kali - Yarrow)]]
Every now and again there comes a carriage to [[New Kali]] that can transport people wherever they want, for a certain cost.
