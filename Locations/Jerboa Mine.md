[[Mining Town of Jerboa]]s primary income. It is a complex tunnel system rich with [[Star fragment]]s. One has to be very careful when casting any sort of magic, since the [[Star fragment]]s in the mine are extremely volatile. 
# Post [[(Session 6) Destructive Activism]]
After witnessing [[Argon Silliax]] create water causing a little domino effect, and giving the miners a minor heart attack, the miners have decided to start making at least a fence around the mine.
# Notes
- Any spell cast might get caught up by a [[Star fragment]] and duplicated in an unwanted position.
- Throwing non magic explosives has the same effect.
