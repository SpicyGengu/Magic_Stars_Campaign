#Magnolian_Sea #Location 
Wine and dine is an inn in [[Magnolia]] that is somewhat an underground establishment. This place is quite unlike any other wine bar in [[Magnolia]]. Of course on the suffice everything appears as normal. Although getting but a wiff of the wine it becomes abundantly clear that most of the wine they sell is in fact blood. The bar is ran by [[Vampire]]s. In fact most of the customers are [[Vampire]]s. The blood they serve is human as well as animal for the morally ratios. 
# The Elder Problem
Being a big gathering spot for [[Vampire]]s, Wine & Dine has become concerned with [[The Elder]]. He has been eating both people and [[Vampire]]s alike. None of the [[Vampire]]s like him because even the [[Vampire]]s who don't have a problem eating people, first of fear for their life's, and second think he is doing it in such a sloppy way, they think [[Magnolia]] might introduce [[Vampire]] hunters. They don't know much else about him, other than the fact that he lives in the [[Abandoned Graveyard]].
