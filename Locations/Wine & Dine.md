#Magnolian_Sea #Location 
Wine and dine is an inn in [[Magnolia]] that is somewhat an underground establishment. This place is quite unlike any other wine bar in [[Magnolia]]. Of course on the suffice everything appears as normal. Although getting but a wiff of the wine it becomes abundantly clear that most of the wine they sell is in fact blood. The bar is ran by [[Vampire]]s. In fact most of the customers are [[Vampire]]s. The blood they serve is human as well as animal for the morally ratios.
