The graveyard is very old. It's been abandoned for quite a while. The newest graves here are already 2 generations old. In the heart of this place is a little morgue. 
# Morgue
Entering the morgue one thing sticks out. A beautiful marble coffin. The patterns etched onto it are riddled with legends. Opening the lid one quickly realises that this isn't no ordinary grave, but a deep dark hole.
# Tomb
Entering the coffin hole a tomb reveals itself. It only has one tunnel and leads to an opening that used to be a stone bridge, but now is just a dead drop. The darkness in the tomb is magical so the players can't see more than 10ft in front of them. This is a bit negated if they light a fire.
