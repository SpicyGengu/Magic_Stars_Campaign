#Location #Magnolian_Sea 
The graveyard is very old. It's been abandoned for quite a while. The newest graves here are already 2 generations old. In the heart of this place is a little morgue. 
# Morgue
Entering the morgue one thing sticks out. A beautiful marble coffin. The patterns etched onto it are riddled with legends. Opening the lid one quickly realises that this isn't no ordinary grave, but a deep dark hole.
# Tomb
Entering the coffin hole a tomb reveals itself. It only has one tunnel and leads to an opening that used to be a stone bridge, but now is just a dead drop. The darkness in the tomb is magical so the players can't see more than 10ft in front of them. This is a bit negated if they light a fire. The tomb has multiple rooms that gradually get reviled only once you've missed them.
# Mushroom Room
Turning back to exit the tomb for the first time the players will notice a new pathway that leads to a room filled with fluorescent fungi growing out of the walls. One of the mushrooms is special though. It is fully made of copper.
# Student Bathroom
Going back to the bridge the team will notice another diverging path leading into a tight room. Only one person can fit in. Moving in it and through it is considered difficult terrain. In this room every time you move 1d4 is rolled. If it's 1 or 2 the person gets sprayed with water and gets a lvl of frightened for 10 minutes. 3 and 4 does nothing. Inside this room there is a mirror. If a [[Vampire]] looks in the mirror they can talk to [[Melany]]. She will want to talk and will answer all questions.
# Maze
Trying to leave once again another path will appear. This one is a maze made of the samme rock as the bridge. In the middle of the maze a large bell. Hitting the bell with anything other than the intended tool, has a chance to shatter the bell.
