The graveyard is very old. It's been abandoned for quite a while. The newest graves here are already 2 generations old. In the heart of this place is a little morgue. 
# Morgue
Entering the morgue one thing sticks out. A beautiful marble coffin. The patterns etched onto it are riddled with legends. Opening the lid they will realise that this isn't just a grave but a deep dark hole.
