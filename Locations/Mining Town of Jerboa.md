#Yarrow_Dessert #Location 
Located in the [[Yarrow Dessert]], Jerboa is one of the biggest mining sites in Yarrow. Being one of the biggest exports of [[Star fragment]]s, the town of Jerboa is in a tight alliance with the [[Living City of Kali]]. In fact most of the [[Star fragment]] produce gets sent straight to Kali. The Jerboan population only gets a fraction of what they actually create. Despite this Jerboans aren't complaining (too much). The town has never been more financially successful, then when they started collaborating with the [[Living City of Kali]].
# Jerboa Rule
Jerboa is ruled by a preacher going by the name [[Paul Mason]]. Planted by the [[Living City of Kali]], [[Paul Mason]] is draining the towns economy with religion.
# Intro sequence
Entering Jerboa, the party will be met by a public execution. [[Paul Mason]] will be doing a ceremony before the [[Alleged Cattle Thieves (Jerboa)]] get hung.
# [[Missing Cattle of Jerboa Situation]]
The [[Woodstock Family]]s cows have recently started disappearing in the night. Being a big source of Jerboan food resources, this is a big problem for the town. [[Paul Mason]] assures the Jerboan people that, these are the punishments from [[The Stars]]. [[Timothy Woodstock]] is convinced, but [[Mary Jane Woodstock]] can't be fooled. She thinks that [[Paul Mason]] has something to do with it, she has heard singing in strange hours of the night.
