#Magnolian_Sea #Location 
Magnolia is a city where streets are filled with water and people filled with metal. Much like real life Venice, Magnolia is a city where instead of roads there are water canals. The whole city is semi underwater. 
# Prosthetic enhancements
Magnolia is also very popular due to its culture of prosthetic enhancements. Almost everyone in Magnolia has some sort of metal limb. These prosthetics usually work just as well as any otherwise biological limb would, sometimes even better. 
# General mindset
Magnolian people are not at all concerned with power, they would much rather drink wine and watch shows their whole life. They love spectacles, and that is reflected in their battle training. Warriors of Magnolia are mostly trained to either be guards or arena performers. They use [[Star fragment]]s for pleasure and convenience, more than for any kind of tactical advantage.
