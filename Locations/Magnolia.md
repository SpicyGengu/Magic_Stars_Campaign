#Magnolian_Sea #Location 
Magnolia is a city where streets are filled with water and people filled with metal. Much like real life Venice, Magnolia is a city where instead of roads there are water canals. The whole city is semi underwater. 
# Prosthetic enhancements
Magnolia is also very popular due to its culture of prosthetic enhancements. Almost everyone in Magnolia has some sort of metal limb. These prosthetics usually work just as well as any otherwise biological limb would, sometimes even better. 
# General mindset
Magnolian people are not at all concerned with power, they would much rather drink wine and watch shows their whole life. They love spectacles, and that is reflected in their battle training. Warriors of Magnolia are mostly trained to either be guards or arena performers. They use [[Star fragment]]s for pleasure and convenience, more than for any kind of tactical advantage. They are very big into voting and believe that every opinion matters.
# [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] Influence
The [[Living City of Kali]] has always wanted influence over Magnolia. They are huge business partners when it comes to trading goods. They have always had mutual respect for each other much to [[Living City of Kali|Kali]]s dismay. [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] has recently started sneaking into Magnolian government little by little. It started by establishing a spy HQ going under the name [[Brass Barbershop]]. They have used all kinds of excuses to control the public a good example being handling the [[Train Heist]] case. Recently they have managed to sway the elections in favour of a head ruler of Magnolia. [[Arthur]] has been elected as a head of state for Magnolia, and the people are still having a hard time getting used to it. The main point of this is to make Magnolia as a whole more prone to manipulation so that the real power can ultimately lay in [[Living City of Kali|Kali]]s hands.
