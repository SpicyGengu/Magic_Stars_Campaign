#Location 
The ocean in this world is quite unlike the ocean in real life. It possesses some magical properties that people have grown accustom to. The ocean itself looks very normal, but sailing long distances for long periods of time, may lead to places much unexpected. The ocean wraps around itself, meaning that sailing north will eventually lead one to the most north point of the map. This is true in all directions. But sailing at night is a very different story. Any ship sailing away from land at night will eventually end up in the [[Living City of Kali]].
