# Post [[(Session 4) The Undying]]
Cleansing the outpost of [[Voda]], the party left the base unoccupied. Since the outpost was a very advantageous spot for [[Voda]], [[Igni]] and [[Gazul]] were quick to take it over, pushing the war back on more of an equal playing field. This upsets [[Violet]] since she was sure her problem was dealt with. If enough time passes [[Maverick]] will be kidnapped and [[Gazul]] will get a new leader.
