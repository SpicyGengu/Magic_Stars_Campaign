#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges #Location #Dead-Gone 
Inside a forest, not too far from [[New Kali]] there is a hidden [[Star Tomb]]. First time entering this tomb, the party will be met by [[Sombra de los Muertos]]. Of course Sombra will advise them very calmly to go away, but he won't stop them. Entering the tomb the party will be met with 3 rooms.
# Room 1
The room on the right contains an altar. Atop the altar there's a giant [[Star fragment]] (worth 100 [[Star fragment]]s), sitting on a fancy red pillow.
# Room 2
Room 2 is the one on the left, and is filled with corpses of dead [[Star Monks]]. The corpses are holding a meditative position. On the walls can be seen depictions of the [[Nameless City]] with pyramids. Also depicted on the walls are drawings of falling stars, something no one has ever seen.
# Room 3
The 3rd room is the biggest. With trees growing from the floor and through the celling, there are also tree roots hanging from the celling. It is very clear that this is the most overgrown part of the tomb. In the middle of the room, ingrown into a tree, there lies an obsidian monolith etched with purple glowing runes. The runes are ancient. No living being should be able to translate them. Guarding the monolith are 3 [[Root Golem]]s. They will appear out of the trees and insta-agro.
# Post [[(Session 3) Coloseum of the Dead]]
The tomb is now raided and destroyed.
