This is a big contributor to [[Living City of Kali|Kali]]s dark underbelly. This facility is used for discovering new spells. The methods used here are incredibly inhumane. Infants are taken here and isolated from the rest of the world, given little to no human interaction throughout their whole lives.
# Theory
The idea is that in order to achieve maximum creativity, one has to be fully devoid of any nurture (nurture vs nature). This is where the isolated infants come in. They know nothing of the real world and are therefore not restricted by any form of norms or etiquette. They are capable of coming up with spells a sorcerer grown up in society could never even think of. 
# Notes
- Plato's cave but the shadows are ones own unfiltered imagination.
