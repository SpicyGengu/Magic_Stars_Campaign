#Stribor_Forest  #NPC 
Two [[Badijan]] soldiers. They used to fight in the [[Badija-Ophilia civil war]]. They fled once they found [[Friendly]]. [[Friendly]] was their golden ticket to success. They were gonna make this freak-show fight in the [[Magnolian Colosseum]] and make millions. They fled to [[Magnolia]], and their plan was working perfectly at first, but then [[Friendly]] escaped. Now they are hiding in the [[Magnolian Slums]] waiting for the first opportunity to get to [[Living City of Kali]]. They can't be left accountable for what carnage that monster is capable of.
