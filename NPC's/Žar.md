#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges/Dracona #NPC 
A fierce leader standing at the forefront of the [[Igni]] tribe. Loved and praised by his whole tribe, by the people of [[Igni]] he is seen as a prophet who will bring forth a new golden age upon the [[Dracona]]. He is situated at the heart of [[Igni Settlement]]. I pity the warriors that spot him on the opposing side of the battlefield.
# Žars Philosophy
Žar was one of the first [[Dracona]] to investigate the village of [[New Kali]] with peaceful intent. Returning from the mission with only one eye and half of his squadron dead, Žar considers [[New Kali]] to be the biggest threat [[The Mountain Tribes]] have ever faced. He believes that the only chance the [[Dracona]] has, to fend off the invaders is if all tribes unite as one once again. Just like the golden age of [[The One Kingdom]]. Žar has long studied the old legends and tails of [[Antesillax]], and while he recognises that politically the tribes are better of semi separate, he can't watch the [[Dracona]] get wiped out by the people of [[New Kali]]. Unfortunately he is right, the power [[The One Kingdom]] had back then has still been unmatched by any of [[The Mountain Tribes]] today. Attempts were made on his side to unite peacefully yet all in vein. Therefor Žar saw no other way and began [[The Tribal War]]. Seeing the only way forward to be union by force.

Žar is now fully aware of what the people of [[New Kali]] are capable of.
