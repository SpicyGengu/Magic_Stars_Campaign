# Backstory 
Lucian Goldworth the not well known middle child of the [[Goldworth Family]]. A family of nobles going back centuries. 

Here we have Lucian; he was never good at school, neither in the political ways of his family. It was always for the same reason, no passion. Seemed like he had little interest in anything except the gun range. Boy could he shoot accurately. Seemed like with an Arquebus in Lucians hand there wasn’t a shot too risky.

At the gun range was where he met [[Bonnie]] (only person that shot better than him), and boy had he never felt so much passion in his life.

He truly loved her so when she asked him to join her in her outlaw weighs he obliged without any question. 

He left and they traveled around town to town ([[Yarrow Dessert]]), made some friends and made some enemies. 

He and [[Bonnie]] lived their amazing outlaw life for 10 years. Then one faithful day he would go out with his sweetheart planning to propose when she suddenly fell ill. She was seriously sick and weeks after, she passed away. 

And suddenly he felt empty, more empty than he ever felt even in his early years. Lucian tried to fill his empty hole with more killing. 

I mean it was all he had left. Shooting… Waiting… Repeat.
