Born and raised in the outskirts of [[Living City of Kali]]. He was always interested in science and technology. He hates aristocrats, because they have held back technologies wonders from blooming, for they don't want everyday people to use it. Instead it is a luxury, for thos who were born with a silver spoon. Yalier dreams of starting his own nation, but he will first need to start with a city (mr house sounding ass). In this town he will reform the way of thinking about technology and status. To help him, his magnum opus: his Armor. His armour could help everyone. Make those physically weak stronger, defend those who can't defend themselves. All he needs to do is tweek a few things, and then he will have, a piece of equipment witch equal hasn't ever been seen before. Therefore, he goes out into the world to find more data, better materials and inspiration for his invention. Despite wanting to start a nation, he doesn't know much about politics or bureaucracy. His intelligence means that he can count on most things. However, he knows that he has to get hold of more people for his dream to come true, and that part is more challenging for him. He is a little eccentric, more interested in things than people. Despite that, he is an empathetic dwarf, and often notices more than people think. However, he is also a bit of an awkward figure, not so good with emotions as these rarely lead to logical actions.
