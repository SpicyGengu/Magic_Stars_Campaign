#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges/Dracona #NPC 
[[Lynn]] and [[Flynn]] are considered by many to be revolutionaries of [[The Mountain Tribes]]. They have taken the role as leaders of [[Voda]], in these dire times. 
# Discovery of [[Dragon Water]]
The reason the twins are at such a high status as they are is due to the fact they were the ones who fairly recently introduced the people of [[Voda]] to [[Dragon Water]]. Without it [[Voda]] would not stand a chance in [[The Tribal War]].
