#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges/Dracona #NPC 
Argon is a blue scaled kobold, which means he likely shares lineage with [[Antesillax]] the lightning king.

He lives on a goat farm with his many siblings, parents and crippled grandpa [[Glass]].

Grandpa [[Glass]] tells exaggerated stories about their ancestors who searched for the [[Lightningspawn]] across the entire mountain range, which filled Argon with ambitions of one day finding it himself.

One day Argons father gets drafted for the war, and since their farm borders an enemy tribes area, they decide to send Argon and his three younger siblings to live with their aunt (mothers side) in the [[Voda]] tribe. Argons two older siblings, his mother and grandpa [[Glass]], stay behind to tend to the farm.

Argon is displeased about being sent to safety with the young, but recognizes that someone has to escort them through the dangerous wilderness, so he dutifully accepts.

After staying in the [[Voda]] tribe for a while, Argon stumbles upon an assassination of the Water Wielder, who lives at the [[Voda]] tribe. Ten [[Igni]] tribe kobolds take down the strangely unguarded Wielder, but only one survives, gravely injured. The surviving assassin consumes the Water wielder's heart, but collapses shortly after escaping the scene. Argon didn’t arrive soon enough to interfere (not that it would have made a difference), but as he looms over the unconscious body of the assassin, he feels a fire burn inside of him. After 16 long years, he takes the first step towards his destiny and carves out the heart of the kobold, as if he was butchering a goat. Then, he devours it.

The next day, chaos ensues. A hunt for the water thief has begun and Argon decides to flee back to his farm within [[Igni]] tribe territory, where the [[Voda]] tribe huntsmen dare not enter. But when he returns home, he finds a pile of ash where the farm used to be. As Argon hastily approaches he finds his beloved grandpa [[Glass]], who is crying next to a scorched sculpture of [[Antesillax]], his right arm badly hurt.

Apparently a group of [[Igni]] tribe warriors had used their farm as shelter, but got attacked by a human group, who tried to burn down the farm with everyone inside. Luckily, a goat managed to alarm everyone by yelling as the humans snuck up, and the [[Igni]] tribe warriors managed to come out victorious. The humans weren’t just random bandits though. They were working with an enemy tribe.

Sadly, they were not able to save the farm from burning down, and Argons family had to flee. Grandpa [[Glass]], who had already far surpassed the expected lifetime of a kobold at 114 years old (most die at 20-30, not from old age) valiantly chose to stay behind, not that he could have joined them with his crippled legs and new injuries.

They talk about what Argon had done. [[Glass]] urges Argon to use his abilities to find the [[Lightningspawn]] who might be hiding somewhere behind a waterlogged cave or beneath a lake, where no one else had been able to go before. Argon feels compelled to do so, but he has a different idea. For 300 years, his ancestors had been looking for the [[Lightningspawn]], but they only ever looked within the mountain range (because this is where dragons live). What if the [[Lightningspawn]] isn’t within the mountain range?

Grandpa [[Glass]] starts to cough up blood, and it seems clear that he is going to die. Death is not rare among the [[Silbian Mountain Ranges]], but it surprises you just the same.

Argon tries to magically heal grandpa [[Glass]] with his newly acquired water magic, but he has no idea how, and ends up killing [[Glass]] instead (womp womp)

Argon spends a week getting more used to his magic, and digs a grave.

Argon sets off on his journey to find the [[Lightningspawn]].

# Post [[(Session 7) Ar-gone Silliax]]
After destroying the [[Jerboa Mine]], Argon was on the run. He left [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]] as fast as he could, knowing someone could be just around the corner to give him what he deserves. He was right, someone was just around the corner, but not even in his wildest dreams could he have guessed who it was. [[Fuji]] somehow survived [[New Kali]] and was now standing in front of him stronger than ever. More vengeful than ever. Argon knew that he didn't stand a chance against Goliath, not alone at least. He fought hard non the less, but it was hopeless. Argon tried bargaining for his life by telling [[Fuji]] that the rest of his company was headed for [[Crows Point]]. This didn't help [[Fuji]] decided to kill him anyways. First stripping him of his tail and then a finishing blow. Argon was by all means dead. By pure luck his spirit was strong enough and he managed to beat [[Sombra de los Muertos]] in the [[Battle for the last breath]]. He was just barely alive. No other person could have survived being in this harsh condition, but Argon was no other person. With his healing magic it only took him a day of recovery before he was on his way again.
