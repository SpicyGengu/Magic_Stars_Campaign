#Magnolian_Sea #NPC 
A champion and a frequent guest at [[Magnolian Colosseum]]. Chainsaw Man gets his name from the 3 prosthetic chainsaws he got implanted onto his body. One on each arm and the 3rd one on his head. He is some of [[Mato Inovatto]]'s finest work. 
# Notes
- When one of his attacks connects, he can use sustain actions to deal damage equivalent to (1d4 * actions used * chainsaws connected), if the enemy moves out of reach, the attack has to connect again.
