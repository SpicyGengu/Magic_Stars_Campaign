A champion and a frequent guest at [[Magnolian Colosseum]]. Chainsaw Man gets his name from the 3 prosthetic chainsaws he got implanted onto his body. One on each arm and the 3rd one on his head. He is some of [[Mato Inovatto]]'s finest work.
# Notes

- He desperately wants to be loved
- He is a very young [[Vampire]]
