#Magnolian_Sea #NPC #Dead-Gone 
A champion and a frequent guest at [[Magnolian Colosseum]]. Chainsaw Man gets his name from the 3 prosthetic chainsaws he got implanted onto his body. One on each arm and the 3rd one on his head. He is some of [[Mato Inovatto]]'s finest work.
# Post [[(Session 11) Greenleaf falls]]
Died by the hands of [[Star Up]] at the [[Magnolian Colosseum]].
# Notes
- When one of his attacks connects, he can use sustain actions to deal damage equivalent to (1d6 * actions used * chainsaws connected), if the enemy moves out of reach, the attack has to connect again.
- He desperately wants to be loved
- He is a very young [[Vampire]]
