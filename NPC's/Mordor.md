#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges/New_Kali #NPC #Dead-Gone 
Mordor is a mage with a specialty in demolition. A former student at [[Kali University]], Mordor spends most of his time trying to create greater and more powerful explosion spells. This experimentation like any other, comes with it's fair share of failures. Unfortunately these failures can be way too destructive. Mordor has become one of [[The Knights of New Kali]] so he can keep up his experiments far away from the [[Living City of Kali]]. Who knows if they are lucky he might just single-handedly wipe out [[New Kali]], by accident of course. He's usually found in the [[New Kali Armoury]].
# Job
Mordor needs some dragon tears. He will strike a deal with anyone willing to go and get them from the [[Bronze Dragon Cave]].
- [[Mordor Contract]]
# Notes
- If Mordor actually gets his bottle of dragon tears, [[New Kali]] will accidentally get nuked
- He is has a hunch-back
