#Silbian_Mountain_Ranges/Kali #NPC 
Conquest is an elite Kali soldier. Born and raised in [[Living City of Kali]] Conquest is 83 years old. He is a human, but don't let that fool you, he packs a serious punch. His name strikes fear in any rational persons eyes. The people at [[Kastel]] don't like him one bit. They think he is unstable. Conquest is often set off to missions because he is a good tool. As of right now he is sent to guard the cargo from the [[Train Heist]].
# Notes
- Whispers conquest's speech to the first enemy he knocks out.
- He is technically of [[Reinhart Family]], but it's a taboo to acknowledge it.
