#Stribor_Forest #NPC 
While she doesn't look the part, Petra is one of the most intelligent wizards of her time. Even though she's a fairly young elf, she has managed to invent a few spells of her own through her carrier. She is constantly working on something new. And due to her ruthless dedication, she has managed to make somewhat of a name for herself, for better or for worse. While being somewhat popular in [[Badija and Ophilia]], she isn't exactly seen as sane or credible. You see Petra has entangled herself in some trouble with the [[Kali Elites]]. Petra's research has at some point lead her to the discovery of [[Disspelling Magic]]. As of now nothing useful, but a big threat to the [[Living City of Kali]]. This has lead Petra's life into a life of hiding. Her whole family has gotten assassinated, and it's even a miracle that she is still alive. Good thing she's smart.
# Politics
Petra was never much for politics, so much so that she doesn't really care if she's [[Badijan]] or [[Ophilian]]. In fact no one knows what she was born as, but most people assume she's an opposition to them due to the propaganda [[Living City of Kali]] is spreading around about her.
