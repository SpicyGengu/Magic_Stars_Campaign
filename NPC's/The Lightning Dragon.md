#Magnolian_Sea #NPC #Dead-Gone 
The Lightning Dragon is a construct created by [[Roar and Thunder]]. The dragon is used for performances happening in [[Magnolia]].
# Appearance
The dragon is fully metal and powered by [[Star Fragment]]s. The design is very [[Magnolia]]n looking very close to the prosthetic people of [[Magnolia]] have. A perfect mix of silver with a hint of gold can be seen all around the dragon, as it is filled with different patterns and recreations of legend running all around it's body. 
# Post [[(Session 11) Greenleaf falls]]
The dragon was defeated by [[Star Up]] in an intense battle at the [[Magnolian Colosseum]].
# Notes
- Should be weak to bludgeoning damage, but resistant to slashing damage.
