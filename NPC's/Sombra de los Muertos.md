#Yarrow_Dessert #NPC 
An entity of legends, no one knows who or what it is. All that is known is that wherever it's seen trouble follows. 
# Godhood
He helps people rid themselves of all their worldly possessions and desires, in order to truly die. He knows how pointless life is without death, which is why he does what he does. He is a crucial part of building legends. When a legend dies Sombra, gives them another chance at life if they can prove themselves in the [[Colosseum of The Damned]]. In this way he rewards people who don't take their life for granted and instead live it to its fullest. He stopped the moving of [[The Stars]] in order to create death.
# [[Grimshot]]'s debt
When [[Bonnie]] fell sick she made a deal with Sombra. [[Grimshot]] and [[Bonnie]] were both going to die of the sickness, [[Grimshot]] just didn't know it, but he had been infected too. In order to prolong [[Grimshot]]'s life [[Bonnie]] gave up her soul to Sombra.
# Notes
