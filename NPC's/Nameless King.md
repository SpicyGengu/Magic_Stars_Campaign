#Yarrow_Dessert #NPC 
An immortal changeling ruling over the [[Nameless City]]. The way they have gained their immortality is due to [[Sombra de los Muertos]] falling in love with them. He is the one keeping them immortal. They have lived for so long that their brain has eventually started overwriting memories. The Nameless King cannot remember how they became immortal.
# Rebirth
Nameless King is able to completely change their character's class, subclass, race, feat, appearance, voice, gender, skill points, and proficiencies.
- Any curse affecting the character will still be present after the rebirth.
- Whilst the character can willingly decide to get their past memories altered and or erased. The memory's can only be altered on the basis of the individuals past experiences and memories, meaning that anything unimaginable to the individual is off-limits. As per usual the DM has the last say for what goes and what doesn't. The character gets an advantage on all charisma (deception and persuasion) checks with the context of it being an altered memory.
