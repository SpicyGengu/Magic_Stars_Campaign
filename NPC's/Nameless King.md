#Yarrow_Dessert #NPC 
An immortal changeling ruling over the [[Nameless City]]. The way they have gained their immortality is due to [[Sombra de los Muertos]] falling in love with them. He is the one keeping them immortal. They have lived for so long that their brain has eventually started overwriting memories. The Nameless King cannot remember how they became immortal.
# Rebirth
Nameless King is able to completely change their character's class, subclass, race, feat, appearance, voice, gender, skill points, and proficiencies.
- Any curse affecting the character will still be present after the rebirth.
- Whilst the character can willingly decide to get their past memories altered and or erased. The memory's can only be altered on the basis of the individuals past experiences and memories, meaning that anything unimaginable to the individual is off-limits. As per usual the DM has the last say for what goes and what doesn't. The character gets an advantage on all charisma (deception and persuasion) checks with the context of it being an altered memory.
- If the full pre-agreed criteria of the Nameless Kings deal isn't met, the Nameless King can of course refuse to go through with the procedure, but he can also decide to go through with the procedure. Going through it this way, the Nameless King will let the character do all changes the player specifies, but will also include some of his own. These changes can only happen if the player hasn't mentioned them in their wishes.
- Whilst the procedure is highly magical, none of it's effects can be detected by detect magic or anything similar.
- The effects are permanent and have the same properties as if the players started with them.
- The Nameless King does not allow changes beyond ones level.
