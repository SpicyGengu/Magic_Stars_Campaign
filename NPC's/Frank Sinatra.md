#Magnolian_Sea #NPC 
Sinatra is an up 'n' coming artist from [[Magnolia]]. He swears that if he can just get to the [[Living City of Kali]] he will hit it big and forever be remembered. He's work does sound promising, but the paperwork just ain't there. No Kalian family, no prior Kali visits no nothing. 
# Job
Frank is desperate to get to the [[Living City of Kali]]. He is willing to pay a lot of money to anyone who can get him there. He doesn't care, he will take out a loan if he has to, he is so certain he will be able to pay it back once he becomes famous. 
# Notes
- If he manages to get to the [[Living City of Kali]] he will become famous in a week or so, and his music will be playing on the radio.
- He runs in much of the same circles as [[Roar and Thunder]] so he knows about [[The Lightning Dragon]].
