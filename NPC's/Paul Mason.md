One could say he's the head of Jerboa, but that wouldn't even come close to how tied around his little finger the people of the [[Mining Town of Jerboa]] are. Be it financial, be it religious, he uses every mean he has to buy out every establishment he can in Jerboa. Being sent to the [[Mining Town of Jerboa]] by the [[Kali Elites]] for one reason and one reason only. Old Paul's purpose here is to extract as much [[Star fragment]] profits from this rotten hole as humanly possible. While he does act as a force of government in Jerboa, he is first and foremost a preacher.
# Political strategy
Paul Mason keeps his political influence closely connected to [[The Stars]] religion. Whilst most of the town believes in it, some like [[Mary Jane Woodstock]] don't buy it. Everything is "a message from [[The Stars]]" for him, no matter how cruel, no matter how hypocritical, IT. JUST. IS.
# Cattle problem
While he is the puppet master of the whole operation, Paul has to publicly pretend to be devastated by the situation. [[Woodstock Family]]s business is one of the last business in this town, he still hasn't managed to buy out. He is hoping that crippling their income will make them fold, and he has just the guy to do it. [[Palamuda Slim]] is his name.
