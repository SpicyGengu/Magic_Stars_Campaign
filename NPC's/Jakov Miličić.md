#NPC #Stribor_Forest 
Jakov Miličić is an [[Ophilian]] blacksmith. Before the war him and [[Dimitar Oklopov]] used to run a shop called [[Zmajev Plamen]]. When the war struck they had to close shop since [[Badijan]]s and [[Ophilian]]s working together was considered taboo. After [[Dimitar Oklopov]] died, Jakov took young [[Petra Oklopova]] under his wing.
# [[Lady Iron]]
Jakov made [[Lady Iron]] to commemorate [[Dimitar Oklopov]]s death. He didn't usually make armours nor shields, but this one was in Dimitars name, so an exception was made.
