Butch is a resident of [[Crows Point]].
# Secret Identity
Butch was hired by the [[Goldworth Family]] to spy on [[Grimshot]] while making sure he's safe. Recently [[Goldworth Family]] stopped paying him, just about the time [[Grimshot]] went to search after [[Sombra de los Muertos]]. This lead Butch to sell out information about [[Grimshot's Vault]] to some local bandits ([[Star Tomb Bandits]]), and proclaim [[Grimshot]] a dead man.
# [[Grimshot's Vault]] Quest
Butch has one of the two keys needed to open the vault.
