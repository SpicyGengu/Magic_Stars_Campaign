#Yarrow_Dessert #NPC 
Butch is a resident of [[Crows Point]].
# Secret Identity
Butch was hired by the [[Goldworth Family]] to spy on [[Grimshot]] while making sure he's safe. Recently [[Goldworth Family]] stopped paying him, just about the time [[Grimshot]] went to search after [[Sombra de los Muertos]]. This lead Butch to sell out information about [[Grimshot's Vault]] to some local bandits ([[Star Tomb Bandits]]), and proclaim [[Grimshot]] a dead man.
# [[Grimshot's Vault]] Quest
Butch has one of the two keys needed to open the vault.
# Post [[(Session 8) What?!]]
The jig is up. [[Grimshot]] knows about the spying, the [[Goldworth Family|Goldworth]]s have stopped the payment, there is nothing left here for poor old Butch. With no reason to stay in [[Crows Point]] he has decided to go back to [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] to get a new job for himself.
