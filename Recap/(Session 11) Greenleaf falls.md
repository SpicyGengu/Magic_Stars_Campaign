#Lore #Recap 
Gathering everyone up our heroes took the caravan of [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]]ns and aimed their corsairs for [[Armadillo]]. This was voted to be the favoured destination for the people. The journey long. It took a full moon to reach [[Armadillo]]. On their way there The gang had made it their goal not only to keep everyone safe, sane and fed, but also to teach and make the remaining people of [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]] in the caravan independent. [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] lead the hunting and scouting expeditions. His followers grew very attached to him, even started following his every word. [[Grimshot]] was in charge of protecting the caravan. Teaching people how to properly use a gun, in order to defend themselves and others if needed. [[Yalier Verdrak]] established a group of builders, who were, together with him, addressed the task of maintaining the caravan wagons. Together with [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)|Calaca]] he would settle disputes when they occurred. This was not [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)|Calaca]]s only duty. She kept up the morale, and made sure to sooth the people psychologically. At the end of each day they would gather into 4 campfires, one for each group. [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)|Calaca]]s was clearly the most desired one. Reaching [[Armadillo]] the towns folk decided to throw a celebration. This time they united all of the campfires into one and celebrated. 2 weeks passed and more houses started to appear. The team now deemed the town self sustainable once more. It was their time to leave. In the morning of their departure, both the settlers and the locals, gave our heroes all the [[Star Fragment]] they could muster, together with a bottle of tequila for each. And with that they wished them farewell. The team had now set out for [[Magnolia]]. A week of travel was all it took for them to reach the beautiful streets of [[Magnolia]]. Roaming around the town they got recognised by non other than [[Jane]]. The same [[Jane]] that survived [[New Kali]] with them all those months ago. She was so relived to see [[Line]] alive and well. They immediately got invited to stay over at her place ([[Jane & Boons House]]). Her and [[Boon]] have moved in together and now live in [[Magnolia]]. Now having a place to stay, the team decided to go sort out what they came here for. [[Mato Inovatto's Workshop]] wasn't all too far away from where they were staying so it was relatively easy to find. [[Yalier Verdrak]] was so excited to meet [[Mato Inovatto]] in the flesh he couldn't hold it in. But when [[Yalier Verdrak]] learned about [[Mato Inovatto]]s pricing... well... some of that excitement definitely faded. Leaving Matos workshop [[Yalier Verdrak]] and [[Grimshot]] wanted to see the alternatives before settling for anything. Lucky for them [[Dropotito Shopolito]] caught them just outside and offered them the same service for one third of the price. He tried taking them into the [[Magnolian Slums]] where his shop was located. Just before entering the slums [[Grimshot]] and [[Yalier Verdrak]] had a change of heart and bailed out. The gang then went to the [[Magnolian Colosseum]] to see the hows and the whats. There they spotted [[Boon]] who was, contrary to what [[Jane]] told them, standing guard at the colosseum. Talking to him they all decided to keep it a secret. The colosseum was doing tryouts the whole month. Curious, they went to see a show. At the show the squad got a general gist of the structure and even got to see [[Chainsaw Man]] fight. The next morning a lot had to be done. [[Yalier Verdrak]] wanted to get a job so that he could help [[Magnolia]] prosper. [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)|Calaca]] found out that [[Magnolia]] had a slam poetry battles as part of it's street culture. She wanted in. [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] went with her. [[Grimshot]] went around trying to figure out more about this new place they were in. A little birdy from [[Brass Barbershop]] told him that [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] was in town, and they were trying to find some outlaws.
