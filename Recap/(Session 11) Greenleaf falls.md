#Lore #Recap 
Gathering everyone up our heroes took the caravan of [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]]ns and aimed their corsairs for [[Armadillo]]. This was voted to be the favoured destination for the people. The journey long. It took a full moon to reach [[Armadillo]]. On their way there The gang had made it their goal not only to keep everyone safe, sane and fed, but also to teach and make the remaining people of [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]] in the caravan independent. [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] lead the hunting and scouting expeditions. His followers grew very attached to him, even started following his every word. [[Grimshot]] was in charge of protecting the caravan. Teaching people how to properly use a gun, in order to defend themselves and others if needed. [[Yalier Verdrak]] established a group of builders, who were, together with him, addressed the task of maintaining the caravan wagons. Together with [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)|Calaca]] he would settle disputes when they occurred. This was not [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)|Calaca]]s only duty. She kept up the morale, and made sure to sooth the people psychologically. At the end of each day they would gather into 4 campfires, one for each group. [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)|Calaca]]s was clearly the most desired one. Reaching [[Armadillo]] the towns folk decided to throw a celebration. This time they united all of the campfires into one and celebrated. 2 weeks passed and more houses started to appear. The team now deemed the town self sustainable once more. It was their time to leave. In the morning of their departure, both the settlers and the locals, gave our heroes all the [[Star Fragment]] they could muster, together with a bottle of tequila for each. And with that they wished them farewell. The team had now set out for [[Magnolia]]. A week of travel was all it took for them to reach the beautiful streets of [[Magnolia]]. Roaming around the town they got recognised by non other than [[Jane]]. The same [[Jane]] that survived [[New Kali]] with them all those months ago. She was so relived to see [[Line]] alive and well. They immediately got invited to stay over at her place ([[Jane & Boons House]]). Her and [[Boon]] have moved in together and now live in [[Magnolia]]. Now having a place to stay, the team decided to go sort out what they came here for. [[Mato Inovatto's Workshop]] wasn't all too far away from where they were staying so it was relatively easy to find. [[Yalier Verdrak]] was so excited to meet [[Mato Inovatto]] in the flesh he couldn't hold it in. But when [[Yalier Verdrak]] learned about [[Mato Inovatto]]s pricing... well... some of that excitement definitely faded. Leaving Matos workshop [[Yalier Verdrak]] and [[Grimshot]] wanted to see the alternatives before settling for anything. Lucky for them [[Dropotito Shopolito]] caught them just outside and offered them the same service for one third of the price. He tried taking them into the [[Magnolian Slums]] where his shop was located. Just before entering the slums [[Grimshot]] and [[Yalier Verdrak]] had a change of heart and bailed out. The gang then went to the [[Magnolian Colosseum]] to see the hows and the whats. There they spotted [[Boon]] who was, contrary to what [[Jane]] told them, standing guard at the colosseum. Talking to him they all decided to keep it a secret. The colosseum was doing tryouts the whole month. Curious, they went to see a show. At the show the squad got a general gist of the structure and even got to see [[Chainsaw Man]] fight. The next morning a lot had to be done. [[Yalier Verdrak]] wanted to get a job so that he could help [[Magnolia]] prosper. [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)|Calaca]] found out that [[Magnolia]] had a slam poetry battles as part of it's street culture. She wanted in. [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] went with her. [[Grimshot]] went around trying to figure out more about this new place they were in. A little birdy from [[Brass Barbershop]] told him that [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] was in town, and they were trying to find some outlaws. In the mean time [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)|Calaca]] went to the [[Magnolian Colosseum]] and tried to get one of the fighting spots for the team. Lucky for her there was one spot for 4 people to fight [[Roar and Thunder]]s [[The Lightning Dragon|Lightning Dragon]]. She took the spot and called our heroes "[[Star Up]]". The team regrouped and went to go see about this job [[Living City of Kali]] was giving out. At the richer district of [[Magnolia]] was a seemingly normal family house, supposed "[[Living City of Kali|Kali]] HQ". They went in for a literal job interview. The squad was very honest while being interviewed, maybe a little too honest... But hey, it is [[Grimshot]]'s biggest flaw after all... right before family issues that is. So after the therapy... I mean interview session, the team was to find who turned out to be [[Antikal (Jerboa)]], for a hefty sum of 1000 [[Star Fragment]]s. A 1000 for finding them and another 1000 for killing them. As they weren't given a tight time schedule they put the task aside (even though none of these people have never seen that much money in their lives). Soon it was time for battle. The locker room was tense. They didn't even really know what they were going up against. There were going to be trees in the arena and they were fighting a [[The Lightning Dragon|Lightning Dragon]]. [[Yalier Verdrak]] prepared 3 lightning rods to absorb some of the attacks the dragon could dish out. All of a sudden cutting through the silence, like a knife, a swift, "... and give it up for, Star Up!". This was it. Their make it or brake it moment. These next few minutes were going to decide whether [[Star Up]] became a new household name, or just another number for the statistics. It all happened so fast. They had [[The Lightning Dragon]] surrounded... or so they thought. [[Fayendel Greenleaf]], one moment he was atop the dragon ready to deliver a killing blow, then in a blink of an eye, [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] was in the dragons mouth. [[The Lightning Dragon]] flew 200 feet up into the air. [[Grimshot]] prepared his rifle aiming it directly at the dragon. He pulled the trigger. A big cloud of ice popped out of the dragons right wing. The lifeless hunk of metal that used to be the dragon and [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] were now falling through the air. Having no idea of what to do, Fayendel called upon [[Sheila]] for guidance. "Don't plea. Join me. Join the cause". This was all Fayendel needed to hear. Falling to the ground [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] woke up in the [[Colosseum of The Damned]], with [[Sombra de los Muertos]] waiting for him once again, but this time it was different. This time he didn't ask for a contest, he asked for one final wish. "Is this truly what you wish for?" [[Sombra de los Muertos|Sombra]] asked. Fayendel was certain. He was willing to join the cause. For his people. The same people that exiled him and abandoned him when he needed them the most. And with that [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] shook [[Sombra de los Muertos]]' hand, finalising his wish. The rest of [[Star Up]] ran as fast as they could to help their fallen brother, but it was too late. [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] was no longer with them. The audience burst out in cheer and applause. Our heroes ran out of the colosseum carrying Fayendels dead body on their shoulders. They found a nice little spot out in the woods under a tree. And there he was buried.
