#Recap #Lore 
Session 1 had [[Grimshot]], [[Argon Silliax]], [[Yalier Verdrak]] and [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] get trapped by the [[Igni]] tribe atop [[Silbian Mountain Ranges]]. They were captured in cages and eventually got captured by one of the [[Giant Ant Colonies]]. They fought long and hard but eventually the [[Igni]] outpost was completely killed and the party was transported to the [[Giant Ant Hive]]. There they got to meet [[Đorđe Balašević]]. He taught them a bit about the world and how the [[Star fragment]]s work sort of. They then left the hive to rest, getting woken up by the [[Matte]] who returned [[Grimshot]] his hat and told them about a man that was looking for him. This man turned out to be [[Sombra de los Muertos]] who in turn told them a bit about their desires. He told them that something they were looking for was, something [[Đorđe Balašević]] knew about. The players turned back to the [[Giant Ant Hive]] and helped [[Đorđe Balašević]] get his ant dew in exchange for some information. [[Yalier Verdrak]] got an ant dew bug of his own while the other players didn't dare taking one. [[Argon Silliax]] caught a glimpse of the [[Living City of Kali]], and as promised [[Đorđe Balašević]] drew them a map to the city of [[New Kali]].
