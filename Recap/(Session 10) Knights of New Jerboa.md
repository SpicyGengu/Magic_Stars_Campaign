#Recap #Lore 
With [[Zina]] now on their side, the crew had set their sights for [[Magnolia]]. In desperate needs of a break, and more importantly new body parts, they were hoping ti kill 2 birds with one stone. They collectively agreed that the best course of action would be to first set their sails for [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]]. They split up (once again). [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)]] went to the meeting point together with [[Grimshot]] to take the [[Star Tomb Bandits]] with them. [[Yalier Verdrak]] went to [[Crows Point]] his priority was on [[Line]]. The two were to take a train to [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]]. And finally [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] tamed a wild horse that he road all the way to [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]]. [[Yalier Verdrak]] and [[Line]] had some financial trouble getting on the train. Luckily the [[Living City of Kali|Kali]] machine is still being run by humans with empathy, and so they got on the train anyways. The star tomb gang had a tough time getting to [[Mining Town of Jerboa|Jerboa]]. [[Yarrow Dessert]] was cruel. It hardened them.
