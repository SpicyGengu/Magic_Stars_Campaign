Waking up in the morning our heroes realized that [[Argon Silliax]] was missing. Only thing he left behind, a poorly written note. A little concerned for him the party didn't waste much time before setting their sails for [[Crows Point]]. On their long journey through the [[Yarrow Dessert]] they encountered a few strange phenomena. Since they were mostly traveling at night, they got a chance to see a plethora of prehistoric marine life specters. Through this they got a little more familiar with the concept of [[Dying]]. On their journey they met some Yarrow bison, saw some train tracks, and even had what they thought was "a close call encounter with [[The Yarrow Breeze]]". After 8 long days, starved and tired they finally made it to [[Crows Point]]. Before resting [[Grimshot]] secretly went out to visit [[Bonnie's Grave]]. To his surprise the grave was accompanied by another more recent grave. A grave of his own. Returning home [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] was suspicious and decided to investigate finding the same two graves. Unfortunately he was only able to extract that one of them had "[[Grimshot]]" written on it. Later that day, [[Grimshot]] decided to catch up with a few of his old friends. [[Hewie One Tusk]] was the first stop. Upon seeing [[Grimshot]] he was in genuine shock and aw. This would prove to be a trend among the [[Crows Point]] residence. Hewie offered to make them food and take care of [[Line]]. He also told them about a new face around town. The name? [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)]]! Thinking this was [[Sombra de los Muertos]], [[Grimshot]] rushed for [[Jenny's House]]. [[Jenny]] seemed to be relatively safe, but the party was still on high alert. Expecting a big confrontation in the garden, the gang was pleasantly surprised to find out this was a different [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)]]. Talking to her led to a lot of real names being reviled. [[Sinclair Family|Sinclair]]!? [[Goldworth Family|Goldworth]]!? [[Yalier Verdrak]] was having none of it. He almost murk-ed [[Grimshot]] on the spot. [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)|Calaca]] could not let that happen, hence she magically pacified him. Turns out [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)]] was also searching for [[Sombra de los Muertos|Sombra]]. Confusing I know. This was about time [[Hewie One Tusk]] was done making food. [[Grimshot]] and [[Hewie One Tusk]] got to reminisce about the good old days. A few things happened after the food, [[Fayendel Greenleaf]] discovered that [[Sombra (Calaca Sinclair)]] has an interesting way of feeding. Although he didn't really seem to mind. [[Grimshot]] got to catch up with the rest of [[Crows Point]]. He noticed that [[Butch]] was acting particularly sketchy. As if he were hiding something. Stealing a letter from [[Butch's House]], the party discovered that [[Butch]] was in contact with the [[Goldworth Family|Goldworth]]'s. The next day our protagonists headed for [[Grimshot's Vault]]. They very quickly they realized that the vault had been raided. [[Grimshot]] knew immediately who was to blame. Catching [[Butch]] just before he managed to flee, the gang decided to question him. This is where all the beans spilled. [[Butch]] has for the better part of 20 years been a spying guardian of [[Grimshot]], hired by [[Grimshot]]'s parents. And that's not even half of it. [[Goldworth Family|Goldworth]]'s recently stopped paying him, witch led him to sell [[Grimshot's Vault]] to some local [[Star Tomb Bandits]], and proclaim [[Grimshot]] dead.
